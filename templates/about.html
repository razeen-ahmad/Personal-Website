            <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Minnesota double majoring
                in finance and computer science. My goal is to secure a position 
                within the financial services industry where I can integrate both of 
                these technical backgrounds while serving others the best way I can.
                For now, I am wholly focused on learning through my coursework and gaining
                experience in the field.
            </p>
            <p>I built this website from scratch out of personal curiosity and to improve on my programming
                skills. I plan on using this site to post a variety of different projects
                that I find interesting while applying my business, math, and computer science knowledge.
                You can find these projects under the portfolio tab!

                        <p>Encephalo Investments is an investment firm based in the Twin Cities.
                            My time as an equity research intern has developed my financial and business acumen, 
                            while giving me opportunities to build on my professional skills within a 
                            startup environment. I provided buy/sell recommendations on individual stocks by analyzing 
                            financial statements and industry specific market trends combined with macroeconomic conditions. 
                            In teams, we created equity research reports and financial models based on quantitative valuations 
                            and fundamental analyses. These reports were presented weekly to company management to discuss 
                            investment opportunities. I also worked with the sotware development team to build screening software 
                            that improved research procedures based on quantitative insights.

                            managing a team within a product development environment. As a member of the financial operations team,
                            I helped build the infrastructure which allowed engineering teams to purchase materials, run diagnostic tests, and 
                            register for official competitions with the solar vehicle. I also maintained financial spreadsheets for documenting 
                            expenditures, contacted corporate sponsors, and secured various grants/funds to ensure the project had the necessary 
                            funding to operate smoothly.

                            gifts. All proceeds from the gift gallery go to the St. Cloud Hospital Auxiliary. Officially, this was not a paid position; 
                            I volunteered my time on a weekly basis. However, my experience operated much like a paid position at a retail store. 
                            We scheduled and filled in shifts on a weekly basis to ensure that the gift gallery could operate as scheduled.
                            As a gift shop associate, I managed deliveries in the hospital by coordinating with supply chain partners to ensure operational efficiency.
                            We provided tenants with necessities in Gift Gallery while maintaining high level of customer service. I also maintained business 
                            operations by placing orders, managing inventory, and recording finances.

                    During the 2020 spring semester, I enrolled in a study abroad program that studied human 
                    resources management in Australia. We worked with students from the Queensland University of 
                    Technology to develop a strategic human resource plan and evaluate its efficacy in a global business 
                    context. Although COVID-19 disrupted our plans, this experience taught me a great deal about 
                    working in a virtual team while reaching across cultural barriers.
