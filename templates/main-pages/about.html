            <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Minnesota double majoring
                in finance and computer science. My goal is to secure a position 
                within the financial services industry where I can integrate both of 
                these technical backgrounds while serving others the best way I can.
                For now, I am wholly focused on learning through my coursework and gaining
                experience in the field.
            </p>
            <p>I coded this website from scratch out of personal curiosity and to improve on my programming
                skills. I plan on using this site to post a variety of different projects
                that I find interesting while applying my business, math, and computer science knowledge.
                You can find these projects under the portfolio tab!

                            My time as an equity research intern has developed my financial and business acumen, 
                            while giving me opportunities to build on my professional skills within a 
                            startup environment. I provided buy/sell recommendations on individual stocks by analyzing 
                            financial statements and industry specific market trends combined with macroeconomic conditions. 
                            In teams, we created equity research reports and financial models based on quantitative valuations 
                            and fundamental analyses. These reports were presented weekly to company management to discuss 
                            investment opportunities. I also worked with the sotware development team to build screening software 
                            that improved research procedures based on quantitative insights.

                            I volunteered my time on a weekly basis. However, my experience operated much like a paid position at a retail store. 
                            We scheduled and filled in shifts on a weekly basis to ensure that the gift gallery could operate as scheduled.
                            As a gift shop associate, I managed deliveries in the hospital by coordinating with supply chain partners to ensure operational efficiency.
                            We provided tenants with necessities in Gift Gallery while maintaining a high level of customer service. I also maintained business 
                            operations by placing orders, managing inventory, and recording finances.

                        From an early age, I have been infatuated with soccer. I would obsessively watch YouTube highlights of Messi, Ronaldo, and Ronaldinho
                        and try to recreate their moves in my backyard. This love for soccer blossomed into a passion for all sports, 
                        although I mainly follow soccer and basketball. While sports mainly serve as a pastime, I've found it as a particularly
                        valuable platform for building my analytical skills. By studying statistics and debating with my friends,
                        I have enhanced my critical thinking and communication skills in ways that could not be replicated elsewhere. With time, I hope
                        to showcase these skills through various projects on this website while spending time with something I am passionate about.

                        Music has always been a part of my life. Like many others, I started out by taking piano lessons. Later, 
                        I transitioned to singing duets with my younger brother. However, after I found the cello in 5th grade, I
                        knew I had found the instrument for me. The size and sound of the cello had me instantly hooked, and I have
                        never looked back since. Through orchestra, I have worked and met with many talented individuals who 
                        showed me the power of hard work, discipline, and teamwork. This culiminated during my junior year of high school, 
                        when I auditioned and was selected for the Minnesota All-State Orchestra. 
                        Although I do not practice like I once used to, I still play my cello on a semi-regular basis. 
                        I find it a nice way to relax my mind and disconnect.

                        about random topics. With the coronavirus lockdown, I would regularly get on a voice calls with my friends
                        to do crosswords together. These puzzles have been a great way for us to stay connected
                        as well as develop our problem solving skills. Although most trivia topics have very little relevance in my 
                        day-to-day life, I am always eager to learn more about the world.
